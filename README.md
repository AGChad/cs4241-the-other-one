# ICE 03: The Other One

In this activity, you will complete a simplified version of A4, specifically using the option you did NOT chooose for that assignment.

### Instructions

1. Divide yourselves into groups of 3 - 5 students. Everybody in your group should have chosen the same option for A4 (creative coding OR components).

2. Go to the version of A4 your group did not choose and complete the assignment with the following modifications:
	* You should fork and submit a pull request against THIS assignment, NOT A4. I suggest one group member fork this assignment and then add the other group members as contributors.
    * **Components:** You should start with the existing submission for A2 or A3 for one of your group members.
    * **Creative Coding:** Your group should choose which of the technologies on the list you want to explore. You must choose at least one but can do more than one.
    * Your README should include your hosting link, the name of all group members, the contributions of each group member, and any instructions necessary to use the application. You can ignore the points in A4 about goals and challenges.

**As this is an in-class activity, we are NOT expecting the same level of complexity as A4.** Do what you can with the time you have. This will be an exercise in effective time management and team communication.
